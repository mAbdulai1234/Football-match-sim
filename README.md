# Football-match-sim project
This code uses JavaScript to create a simulated sports match by leveraging its randomization, logging, and looping functions. Through Math.floor() and Math.random(), it generates random events each minute, while console.log() outputs these events in a way that resembles real-time commentary. JavaScript's loops and conditional statements enable the orderly progression of the match, with each minute advancing systematically. This example showcases JavaScriptâ€™s adaptability in building event-based simulations, underscoring its usefulness beyond typical web development tasks.
